        Introduction Semantic-UI-Ember
        <span class="sub header">
          This is the official Ember library for the Semantic-UI modules.
          The code was original built for

            CrowdOx
          </a>

    Project Philosophy
  </h2>
  <div class="no example">
    <p>
      We feel that the Semantic-UI-Ember project should simply be an extension of Semantic-UI. It should not rewrite or replace any of the built-in functionality.
      With that in mind, the project will always be a very lightweight layer on top of Semantic-UI to make the integration a first-class Ember experience.
      We will
      <a href="http://semantic-ui.com" target="_blank">
        follow the official documentation
      </a>
      as closely as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main focus of this add-on is on the Semantic-UI modules.
      <em>
        Anything that's not a module (i.e. segment, button, etc), should be added to your templates as plain HTML.
      </em>
      We didn't find any value in creating Ember components that in the end represented simple HTML elements.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the 2.0 release which focuses on Data Down Actions Up as the way to interact with Semantic-UI.
      We've moved away from data bindings to be more inline with Ember, and we found it better ties into Semantic-UI's existing events.
    </p>
    <p>

    Installation
  </h2>
  <div class="no example">
    <p>
      Install this add-on through Ember CLI
    </p>
    <p>
      From the command line run:
    </p>
    <div class="ui label">
      v3.0
    </div>
    <UiAnnotation @showing={{true}} type="bash" @snippet="index.install.3.hbs" />
    <div class="ui label">
      v2.1
    </div>
    <UiAnnotation @showing={{true}} type="bash" @snippet="index.install.21.hbs" />
    <div class="ui label">
      v2.0
    </div>
    <UiAnnotation @showing={{true}} type="bash" @snippet="index.install.2.hbs" />
    <div class="ui yellow message small">
      v2.1 and above do not need bower dependencies, and hence no blueprints are necessary to run.
      <br />
      <br />
      For v2.0, we require bower. If you are on Ember CLI
      <i>
        below v2.16
      </i>
      , addon blueprints are not run by default
      Once installed, run the library's blueprint to pull in its Bower dependencies. This only needs to be done once.

    Using Custom Semantic UI Theme
  </h2>
  <div class="no example">
    <p>
      Run the following blueprint. This will remove
      <code>
        semantic-ui-css
      </code>
      , which is prebuilt
      default semantic-ui, and install
      <code>
        semantic-ui-less
      </code>
      that can be customized as per your
      needs
